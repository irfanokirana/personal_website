        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>During my internship at PDC Energy, I was tasked with analyzing a 50-year dataset of oil production levels to identify key factors driving production increases. Collaborating with the reservoir engineering team, who had limited experience with data analysis and machine learning, I independently applied my classroom knowledge and self-guided study to develop effective analytical strategies. Although I received minimal guidance in data science, my supervisor provided invaluable insights into the oil and gas industry. To interpret the dataset effectively, I deepened my understanding of oil drilling and production processes, enabling me to recognize the significance of various features and values within the data. </p>
        
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        
        <p>The dataset contained over 120 features and more than 50,000 data samples collected over many years. The initial step in tackling this problem was data preprocessing. I began by cleaning the data, removing null or empty values, and normalizing certain columns to facilitate analysis. Regularization was also applied to improve accuracy. </p>
        
        <p>After cleaning, the data was split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set. I created visualizations to assess which model and features would be most useful in predicting oil production. To identify the most significant features, I trained a series of single-feature models, examining the coefficients to determine which features had the greatest impact. Many features displayed similar trends with respect to the target variable, so I retained only one from each highly correlated group for the final analysis. </p>
        
        <p>Through this process, I observed a clear linear relationship between the selected features and the target variable, leading me to train a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model on the training set. While MLR results were promising, they did not fully meet our accuracy threshold. I then applied a Random Forest model, which demonstrated lower bias and variance. This model, trained with 20 of the most impactful features from the original set, achieved strong results with an R-squared value of 0.83 and a low mean squared error. </p>
        
        <p>To further enhance the predictive power, I went beyond the initial requirements, using machine learning techniques to hyper-tune parameters for optimal oil production. We ultimately selected IBM's regression optimization tool to simulate scenarios that could maximize output, achieving insights beyond our initial objectives. </p>
        
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        
        <p>At the end of my internship, I delivered a presentation on my findings to a group of oil and gas engineers, senior management, and fellow interns. Recognizing that many attendees had limited familiarity with machine learning, I took the opportunity to explain the techniques and methodologies I used to reach my conclusions. In many ways, this internship felt like a collaborative partnershipâ€”I provided support to the reservoir engineering team in making data-driven predictions about oil production, while gaining valuable insights into the oil and gas industry myself. </p>
